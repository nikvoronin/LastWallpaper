```

- `The Last Wallpaper` - reminds you that you don't need other wallpaper apps.
- `‚≠êpodname` - the name of the source of the picture-of-the-day.
- `3 June 2024` - the date of the picture-of-the-day (not only today).
- `16:43` - when the POD- image was successfully downloaded.

üéØ Do right mouse click over the tray icon:

- __Update Now!__ - check and update wallpaper immediatelly.
